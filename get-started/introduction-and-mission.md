# Introduction & Mission

#### Current State of Internet <a href="#current-state-of-internet" id="current-state-of-internet"></a>

Today's internet was designed only for humans, but AI agents will have even more significant roles in near future. Without a new approach, it will suffer from lack of identity, trust, and scalable payments.

## <sup><sub>Kite - The First AI Payment Blockchain<sub></sup>

* AI agents are becoming main player of economy
* However, infrastructure is not ready
  * It is risky for users to delegate payments to AI agents since AI agent is blackbox
  * It is risky for merchants to receive payments from AI agents since there is no clear liability on those payments
* Kite is **a foundational infrastructure empowering autonomous agents to operate and transact with identity, payment, governance, and verification.**

**Why Kite?**

<details>

<summary>3 tiers of ID for fine-grained governance</summary>

The user → agent → session identity hierarchy separates root authority (user), delegated authority (agent), and ephemeral authority (session). This enables precise controls like per-agent spending limits, time windows, and whitelisted providers without exposing master keys.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Verifiable proof of delegations</summary>

Every operation is cryptographically signed and anchored on-chain, producing tamper-evident audit trails. Services and auditors can verify who authorized what, when, and under which constraints—no screenshots or manual logs required.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Programmable guard rails</summary>

Set enforceable constraints like daily budgets, provider allowlists, rate limits, or conditional rules (e.g., “halve limits if volatility > 20%”). These compile to smart contract enforcement, so agents cannot exceed policy even if compromised.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Native agentic protocol support</summary>

Compatible with A2A, AP2, MCP, OAuth 2.1, and emerging standards in AI agent communication.

</details>

<details>

<summary>AI agent-native stablecoin payment</summary>

Streaming micropayments and pay-per-call economics via state channels and stablecoin-native settlement. Agents discover, negotiate, and pay for services instantly with predictable costs and sub-100ms latency.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Near zero gas fee</summary>

Chain is optimized for agent throughput with near-zero fees (often <$0.000001) and \~1s block times, enabling practical microtransactions and high-frequency agent interactions at scale.
