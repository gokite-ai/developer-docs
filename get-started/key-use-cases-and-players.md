# Key Use Cases & Players

## Agentic Commerce

**What it is:** Consumers use personal AI agents for shopping, both with and without human presence.

**Current Problems:**
- **Consumer Risk:** Delegating permanent payment methods to AI agents is too risky
- **Merchant Risk:** Receiving payments from unknown AI entities creates AML/fraud concerns

**How Kite Helps:**
- **Agent Builders:** Integrate Kite Passport SDK/MCP for consumer/agent authentication on Kite ID registry
- **Delegation Proof:** Record verifiable proof of delegation on blockchain through Kite Passport (similar to Google AP2 "Mandate" concept)
- **Merchants:** Integrate Kite API to initiate stablecoin transfers, verify payments, and fetch delegation proofs

## Automatic Sourcing

**What it is:** AI-powered sourcing optimization for manufacturing (cost, lead time, production planning, carbon emissions).

**Current Problems:**
- Same delegation risks as agentic commerce
- High foreign exchange costs for international payments

**How Kite Helps:**
- Secure delegation mechanisms
- Cost savings through stablecoin payments instead of traditional FX

## Portfolio Management

**What it is:** AI-driven investment timing and portfolio optimization.

**Current Problems:**
- Need for solid control beyond just prompt instructions

**How Kite Helps:**
- Programmable guard rails for investment constraints and risk management

## AI Agent Services

**What it is:** Data, model, and tool services specifically designed for AI agents.

**Current Problems:**
- Complex micro-transaction handling
- Difficult pay-per-use integration

**How Kite Helps:**
- Enables autonomous micro-transactions through AI agents
- Streamlines pay-per-use service integration
