<details>

<summary>What is the Kite platform and why build on it?</summary>



Kite is a sovereign Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for AI-centric applications, offering high throughput and low latency for complex AI workloads.

* **Open AI Marketplace:** It provides an open marketplace for datasets and AI agents, enabling easy discovery and monetization.
* **Customizable Modules:** Developers can create or join specialized modules to optimize data pipelines, privacy, and computational performance for targeted AI use cases.
* **Ownership and Rewards:** By leveraging this specialized infrastructure, you can **own** your data and models, control pricing for usage, and receive **transparent rewards** for contributions.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I deploy my AI agents on this platform?</summary>

There are two ways to deploy your agents and models. Though the GUI and through CLI ( coming soon). Steps explained below:

* **Develop Your Agent:** Package your AI logic as a Docker image.
* **Publish and Deploy:** Use the provided CLI tools to publish and deploy your AI agent onto your chosen module or the default community module.
* **Manage Agents:** Through the dashboard, you can manage your agents, monitor usage, set your pricing, and track income distribution.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does the monetization or incentive structure work?</summary>

The monetization and incentive structure is based on role of the participant and contribution/demand of their attribution to the platform.&#x20;

* **Token-Based Rewards:** Contributors (e.g., AI Builders, Data Providers, AI infra partners) earn platform tokens based on usage of their assets (datasets or agents or Infra).
* **Marketplace Listing:** When you publish data or an AI agent, you set the price. Consumers pay in tokens upon usage; the platform tracks usage automatically.
* **Income Distribution:** Module owners and creators can withdraw accrued income and distribute it among contributors in their module.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I select modules, and how many can I use?</summary>

Each module can be optimized for specific use cases, high-throughput data ingestion, specialized AI modeling, etc.

* **Flexibility:** You can join multiple modules if your projects span different domains.
* **Access Controls:** Some modules are invite-only (private), while others are open to all developers.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Can I become a module owner and also a validator?</summary>

* Yes. Module owners manage membership, invite new participants, and oversee reward distribution.

- You can also run a validator node to secure the module, confirm transactions, and earn token rewards for those servic

</details>

<details>

<summary>What do validators do on KITE blockchain and how are rewards earned?</summary>

* **Transaction Confirmation:** Validators confirm transactions and maintain network security.
* **Earning Rewards:** They earn tokens for providing these services, with rewards often tied to factors like stake, workload, or accuracy.
* **Staking:** By staking tokens, validators ensure security and can receive proportional rewards.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What privacy measures does the platform offer for data?</summary>

On the Kite platform. users can choose to process data  locally or in a controlled-access environment.

* **Sovereign Control:** Owners have full control over how data is shared and monetized.
* **Secure, Decentralized Infrastructure:** The Layer-1 design ensures data attribution is secure and usage is transparent.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Is there a step-by-step guide on how to upload data, especially if I process large volumes daily?</summary>

large data can be uploaded though CLI for agents ( in progress) and though Python SDK. The steps are as detailed below :&#x20;

* **Create a Dataset:** In the dashboard, select “Create Dataset.”
* **Use the Python SDK:** Initialize and authenticate your session, then upload data in batches—especially useful for large-scale processes.
* **Publish Your Data:** Set pricing and visibility, then publish.
* **Manage Tables:** Organize tables in the data management section to monitor usage, performance, and income.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does on-chain registration of platform activities work in practice? Can you provide examples?</summary>

While there are quite a few activities and events that are tracked on chain for various use cases, below are a high level overview of the categories and some examples of on chain registration (these are also applicable for AI agents and AI models):

* **Immutable Record:** Key actions, dataset uploads, agent deployments, income distributions are recorded on-chain.
* **Example:** When creating a new dataset, the platform logs a transaction with the dataset’s metadata and ownership details. Subsequent usage (queries, agent calls) also gets recorded, ensuring transparent reward calculations.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does the platform plan to integrate with specific decentralized storage solutions?</summary>

KITE AI emphasizes its built-in decentralized storage and local data processing capabilities. While discussing with third-party integrations (e.g., Filecoin & Walrus) are in flight, exact technical details or timelines are not yet finalised.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are there caveats to working with this platform alongside other solutions or independently?</summary>

Kite AI platform is a decentralised platform for end users, ai builders and data providers. It provides benefits in various ways :&#x20;

* **Open Marketplace:** You have full control over listing your data or agents.
* **Collaboration Benefits:** Joining a module can offer shared incentives and community-driven development.
* **Independent Deployment:** There are no restrictions on deploying and monetizing your own assets independently, as long as you follow platform guidelines.
