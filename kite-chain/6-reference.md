# Security at Kite

## Security at Kite&#x20;

At Kite, security is not an afterthought, it’s built into the architecture. We implement a shift-left security mindset, applying best practices from design to production. Through layered defenses, independent audits, and an internal Security Officer overseeing continuous DevSecOps monitoring, we ensure that every component of the Kite AI Layer-1 and its services meets global security standards. Our Security Principles:\


* First-class citizen: Security, reliability, and safety are treated as core UX. Features do not ship unless they meet security acceptance criteria.
* Shift-Left: Threat modeling, secure design reviews, and automated checks start at the ideation and PRD (Product requirement Design) stage, not after code freeze.
* Defense-in-Depth: Multiple independent layers protect keys, code, infrastructure, and funds; single points of failure are designed out.
* Least Privilege & Zero Trust: Minimize blast radius through scoped roles, short-lived credentials, strong auth, and continuous verification.
* Transparency & Verifiability: On-chain proofs, public audit artifacts, and immutable changelogs where possible.
* Independent Assurance: We engage top security firms ( such as Halborn) for smart-contract and protocol audits, and commission independent penetration tests by  reputed security partner.
* Verified Authorization: By combining multi-signature (multi-sig) wallet technology with advanced access controls, Kite minimizes single points of failure and ensures that critical operations always require verified authorization.
* 24/7 monitoring for both Web2.0 and Web3.0 vulnerabilities and incidents.

**Note:** We will publish audit reports and pen-test summaries (with sanitized details) on demand.
