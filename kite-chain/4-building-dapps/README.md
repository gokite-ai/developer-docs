# Building dApps

Learn how to build complete decentralized applications (dApps) with React frontends that interact with your smart contracts.

## Sample dApps

This section provides full-stack examples using React and Ethers.js:

* [**Counter dApp**](counter-dapp.md) - Simple counter interface with wallet connection
* [**Voting dApp**](voting-dapp.md) - Decentralized voting system with real-time results
* [**Token Minter**](token-minter.md) - Create and manage custom tokens

## What You'll Learn

* Setting up React applications for Web3
* Connecting to MetaMask and other wallets
* Interacting with smart contracts using Ethers.js
* Handling transactions and user feedback
* Building responsive Web3 UIs

## Tech Stack

All examples use modern Web3 development tools:

* **React** - Frontend framework
* **Ethers.js** - Ethereum library for contract interaction
* **MetaMask** - Wallet integration
* **Kite Testnet** - Deploy and test your dApps

## Live Examples

Try our deployed examples:

* Counter dApp: [https://kite-counter-dapp.vercel.app/](https://kite-counter-dapp.vercel.app/)

All source code is available on GitHub for you to fork and modify.

## Development Workflow

1. **Deploy Smart Contracts** - Use contracts from the [Developing](../3-developing/) section
2. **Build Frontend** - Create React components that connect to your contracts
3. **Test Locally** - Run your dApp with a local development server
4. **Deploy** - Host your frontend on Vercel, Netlify, or similar platforms

## Prerequisites

Before building dApps:

* Complete the [Smart Contract Development](../3-developing/) tutorials
* Have basic React knowledge
* Understand async/await JavaScript patterns

## Next Steps

After building dApps:

* Explore [Advanced Features](../5-advanced/) like Account Abstraction and Multisig
* Review [Security Best Practices](../6-reference/security.md)
* Deploy to production and check [Node Operations](broken-reference)
