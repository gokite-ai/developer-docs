# Building smart contract on KiteAI

### Smart Contract Development

* Supported Languages (e.g., Solidity)
* Creating AI-Centric Smart Contracts

Kite provides a [suite of contracts](https://kite-ai.gitbook.io/subnet-docs/building-on-kite-ai/smart-contracts-list) and libraries offers a modular, on-chain framework for developers can quickly build decentralized AI marketplaces and data-driven platforms, fostering scalable, secure, and efficient collaboration in a trustless environment:

* Creating and managing assets: Deploy and govern machine learning models, datasets, agents, and related services.
* Monetizing resources: Implement flexible fee distribution mechanisms to fairly reward data providers, model creators, and other stakeholders.
* Ensuring secure governance: Leverage role-based access control for transparent permissioning and trustless collaboration.
* Streamlining operations: Use factories for easy asset creation, registries for subnet management, and job managers for orchestrating training, deployment, and other tasks.

In this section, we will share how to develop two sample contracts with Kite AI with Remix and Hardhat for 2 different decentralised applicaton:&#x20;

1. [Counter dApp](counter-smart-contract.md) [Remix and HardHat]
2. [Voting dApp](voting-smart-contract.md) [Remix only]

Lets begin ...!
