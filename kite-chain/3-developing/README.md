# Developing Smart Contracts on Kite Chain

Learn how to write, deploy, and interact with smart contracts on Kite Chain using industry-standard tools.

## What You'll Build

This section walks you through creating smart contracts with practical examples:

- **[Setup Environment](setup-environment.md)** - Configure your development environment with necessary tools
- **[Counter Contract - Remix](counter-smart-contract-remix.md)** - Build a simple counter using Remix IDE
- **[Counter Contract - Hardhat](counter-smart-contract-hardhat.md)** - Build the same contract using Hardhat framework
- **[Voting Contract](voting-smart-contract.md)** - Create a decentralized voting system
- **[Smart Contracts List](smart-contracts-list.md)** - Pre-deployed contracts and libraries available on Kite

## Development Tools

Kite Chain supports standard Ethereum development tools:
- **Remix IDE** - Browser-based development environment (no installation required)
- **Hardhat** - Professional development framework with testing and deployment
- **Solidity** - The primary smart contract programming language

## Kite's Smart Contract Framework

Kite provides a modular, on-chain framework for building AI-driven applications:

- **Creating and managing assets** - Deploy and govern ML models, datasets, agents, and services
- **Monetizing resources** - Implement flexible fee distribution for data providers and creators
- **Ensuring secure governance** - Leverage role-based access control for transparent collaboration
- **Streamlining operations** - Use factories, registries, and job managers for orchestration

## Learning Path

1. **Start with Setup** - Get your development environment ready
2. **Try Remix** - Quick start with browser-based development
3. **Move to Hardhat** - Professional workflows with testing and scripts
4. **Build Real Projects** - Create voting systems and explore pre-deployed contracts

## Next Steps

After developing contracts:
- Build complete [dApps](../4-building-dapps/README.md) with React frontends
- Explore [Advanced Features](../5-advanced/README.md) like Account Abstraction
- Review [Reference Documentation](../6-reference/README.md) for production deployments
