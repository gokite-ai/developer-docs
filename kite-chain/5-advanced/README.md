# Advanced Features

Take your Kite Chain development to the next level with advanced blockchain features and tools.

## What's Covered

* [**Account Abstraction SDK**](account-abstraction-sdk.md) - Simplify user onboarding with gasless transactions and smart accounts
* [**Multisig Wallet**](multisig-wallet.md) - Secure multi-signature wallet implementation for team asset management

## Account Abstraction

Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) enables:

* **Gasless transactions** - Sponsor gas fees for your users
* **Social recovery** - Recover accounts without seed phrases
* **Batch transactions** - Execute multiple operations in one transaction
* **Custom validation logic** - Implement advanced security rules

Perfect for improving user experience and removing Web3 friction points.

## Multisig Wallets

Multisig wallets provide:

* **Shared control** - Require multiple signatures for transactions
* **Team treasury management** - Secure funds with distributed authority
* **Proposal and voting** - Democratic decision-making for critical operations
* **Enhanced security** - No single point of failure

Essential for DAOs, teams, and organizations managing significant assets.

## Who This Is For

These features are ideal for:

* **Product teams** building user-friendly dApps
* **DAOs and organizations** managing shared resources
* **Advanced developers** implementing sophisticated smart contract patterns
* **Projects** requiring enhanced security and UX

## Implementation Patterns

Both features can be combined:

* Use Account Abstraction for end-user accounts
* Implement Multisig for treasury and governance
* Create hybrid systems with layered security

## Prerequisites
